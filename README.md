# Coral

A simple consistent compilation framework based on Makefiles.

This project is suitable for compiled languages, typically C programming language, and Unix-like OS, typically Linux.

## Tutorial

* type `make` in any directory containing a Makefile file to generate libraries and/or executables.
* type `make clean` in any directory containing a Makefile file to clean up what `make` generated.
* create a directory, copy src/mod1/Makefile into the directory, write one or more src.c, just `make` to generate a library.
* create a directory, copy src/tool1/Makefile into the directory, write one main.c and/or more src.c, just `make` to generate a executable.
